    <h1>Research</h1> <br>

    <h5>
        In a rapidly expanding food industry, individuals' appetites are basically interminable. They demand newer
        dining options, leading to increased reliance on digital platforms to evaluate dining options. However, there
        remains a significant gap in reliable and localized information about food enterprises in Saudi Arabia, which
        Yalla will aim to solve. Yalla seeks to fill this gap by providing a platform dedicated for sharing said
        information about prominent and newly-emerging restaurants, as well as informing users about essential details
        such as menus, working hours, and dish categories. By improving the visibility of small food enterprises and
        offering users trustworthy, up-to-date reviews, Yalla aims to support local businesses and enhance the overall
        dining experience for its community.
        <br><br>
        Initially, the website will be limited to users in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It will enable individuals to
        contribute by sharing their own reviews and information about specific businesses, thereby informing those who
        may be unfamiliar with local restaurants, such as tourists. Furthermore, it introduces users to a wide range of
        cuisines they may not have previously experienced and encourages them to explore and try new options. However,
        if the website's popularity increases, the website can expand its scope to other cities in Saudi Arabia, such as
        Riyadh and Dammam. Currently, there are no plans for this website to expand further, as doing so would require
        extensive planning and organization to broaden its functionalities across the entirety of Saudi Arabia.
        <br><br>
        Surprisingly, no dedicated app currently enables users to review or rate restaurants across Jeddah, aside from
        Google Maps. However, Google Maps may contain inaccurate, outdated, or biased reviews and ratings. Yalla aims to
        mitigate these problems by providing reliable, up-to-date reviews that help users more accurately assess whether
        a business is worth visiting, while also offering a broad selection of food establishments for users to explore.
        Another issue this website aims to tackle is lack of publicity. Many food enterprises are relatively obscure,
        despite often offering significantly lower prices than larger competitors for similar products. Through Yalla,
        these restaurants can gain increased visibility, helping them avoid closure while enabling users to discover and
        enjoy the unique offerings of these restaurants.
        <br><br>
        Essentially, the website includes short-term and long-term objectives. Short-term objectives are, but not
        limited to, laying the foundation of the platform, experimenting with adding new places to review, implementing
        an account and login system, and creating a tab to search for restaurants with specific tags. Long-term
        objectives include hosting the website on its own domain, leaderboards and titles for top reviewers,
        collaboration with businesses to advertise their restaurants within the application, and implementing a
        pick-up-your-food functionality. Furthermore, the website aims to solve some primary questions that include: (1)
        In what way can the website target small food businesses in Jeddah to increase their visibility and engagement?
        (2) How can the website influence the KKIS community while discovering and supporting small food businesses in
        Jeddah? (3) What motivates food enterprises in Jeddah to collaborate and participate with the website to promote
        their own business? Answering these questions requires essential values that the platform will build on. These
        values include embracing diversity, where food from different areas of the world, such as Jordanian, Saudi,
        Italian, Mexican, and more food, are integrated as part of the website; stewardship, as users must ensure
        complete accuracy and honesty in their reviews; community impact, as this platform benefits the community as a
        whole; and cooperation and collaboration, where users must cooperate and collaborate to benefit the entire
        community of the platform.
        <br><br>
        The main thesis, which the website is built on, is that if ratings, reviews, and information about food
        businesses are made easily accessible through a simple web application, then users will be more likely to
        discover, evaluate, and support businesses, particularly small ones, leading to greater visibility and community
        engagement, because accessible and trustworthy reviews increase publicity and encourage users to interact with a
        business. Validating this hypothesis requires data collection; therefore, this applied course research will
        gather primary quantitative and qualitative data to support the website’s improvement and optimization.
        Furthermore, the website will be implemented over a period of six months, during which the project will undergo
        updates and add features that give it its unique touch. October and November will serve as the learning and
        foundational development phase, during which the researcher will acquire knowledge of coding languages such as
        HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript. From December through March, new functionalities will be progressively
        implemented, including features proposed by users and informed by data gathered from primary sources.
        In conclusion, with easily accessible information and reviews about food businesses through a web application
        like Yalla, users are more encouraged to explore said businesses, namely small, growing businesses, leading to a
        greater visibility and engagement across the website's community, which is the website's purpose. Additional
        objectives of the website include increasing exposure for small businesses, offering users diverse food and dish
        recommendations, and providing a dedicated section for restaurant promotion. As the platform grows in popularity
        and user engagement, it may further expand its coverage to additional cities in Saudi Arabia, such as Riyadh and
        Dammam.
        <br><br>
        Online review platforms have become ubiquitous, playing a major role in shaping consumer opinions about products, services, and places. One notable focus of online reviewing platforms is on restaurants. Many platforms allow the community to rate and review restaurants, offering both criticism and praise. These reviews and ratings often influence whether potential customers decide to visit a particular food establishment. With the advancement of technology, the impact of these reviews has grown even stronger. A study by Chen et al. shows that by using eyetracking systems, people are apt to focus more on negative comments than positive comments (2022). Additionally, there is a pressing need for a reliable website that accurately represents a restaurant's quality in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. For instance, Yelp has been the leading restaurant review platform (hereafter RRP) since 2004, receiving approximately 130 million visitors and 70 million reviews each month (Salehi-Esfahani & Kang, 2019). However, Yelp is only available in select locations, and it does not include Jeddah or any part of Saudi Arabia. Hence, there is a demand for a reliable restaurant review platform in Jeddah. This literature review will examine the role of RRPs in data collection, user decision-making, and small business visibility and engagement to show how Yalla, the first Saudi-based RRP, will fill the gap in the literature and achieve its aims of enhancing user dining experiences and supporting local businesses in Jeddah.
        <br><br>
        From an operational standpoint, RRPs play a crucial role in data collection and analysis for food businesses; thus, many of these establishments rely on consumer reviews and ratings to improve their products and services. In their study, Salehi-Esfahani and Kang demonstrated that by utilizing the Technology Acceptance Model, restaurants can effectively leverage user feedback to enhance their services (2019). Moreover, a study by Dai et al. showed that aggregated consumer ratings can be analyzed to yield more accurate measures of restaurant quality (2017). Recently, a study by Fe illustrates her use of a machine learning technique known as hierarchical clustering, applied to Yelp data, to analyze the impact of social network friendships on restaurant selections (2023). This suggests that restaurants should leverage customers' social networks to enhance engagement and motivate user participation.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, RRPs have played a crucial role in shaping user exploration of restaurants. Research by Shaheen et al. reveals that users’ perceptions and attitudes towards a restaurant are significantly influenced by what they perceive as credible reviews in RRPs (2019). Their findings indicate that customers are swayed by what they consider credible reviews, which directly impacts their purchasing intentions, emphasizing the importance of online platforms prioritizing credible and valuable information to effectively engage and guide customers with their exploration.
        <br><br>
        For small businesses, online marketing techniques are vital as they enhance small businesses’ visibility to potential customers in RRPs, which is a critical advantage in the competitive landscape (Shafique, 2024). Even if this edge diminishes in the face of increased competition, small businesses tend to benefit from more positively skewed reviews and generally encounter less polarized sentiment compared to chain restaurants, under the assumption that these smaller establishments offer strong testimonials that justify their positive feedback (Yalcinkaya & Just, 2022).
        <br><br>
        Taking into consideration the compelling evidence, we must examine why food businesses are not leveraging data from RRPs. There are also significant concerns regarding the limited dish options available to users, despite restaurants offering a “wide variety of dishes.” Moreover, small businesses are forced into closure despite using online marketing techniques to attempt to fuel their progress. All of these concerns and issues can be resolved by one simple answer: the lack of a centralized, legitimate, and reliable RRP in numerous regions worldwide. This is where the restaurant review platform Yalla aims to bridge the gap in existing literature.
        <br><br>
        Yalla seeks to address the critical challenges associated with ineffective data collection and analysis within the restaurant industry. While platforms like Yelp offer extensive data for the markets they serve, such data and resources are notably nonexistent in cities such as Jeddah, where there are little to no reliable RRPs. By filling this void, Yalla has the potential to enable small enterprises to leverage insights that can drive improvements. In turn, users will benefit from access to a trustworthy source of aggregated local information, enhancing their dining experiences.
        <br><br>
        Furthermore, a dominant local platform such as Yalla will ease user exploration of specific food establishments that may otherwise remain obscure. The fragmentation of user exploration across social media, word-of-mouth, and international applications like Yelp, with their limited local data, prevents the development of a comprehensive database, complicating informed decision-making for users and stifling exploration of local cuisines. Through Yalla, such complications will be settled, and users and restaurants alike will benefit significantly from Yalla.
        <br><br>
        Finally, small businesses will gain significant advantages from a centralized RRP like Yalla. In Jeddah, small restaurant shops struggle to leverage the potential of positive reviews, making online marketing techniques ineffective. Yalla aims to emerge as the consolidated online reputation platform, spotlighting these small businesses and fostering their growth in the competitive world.
