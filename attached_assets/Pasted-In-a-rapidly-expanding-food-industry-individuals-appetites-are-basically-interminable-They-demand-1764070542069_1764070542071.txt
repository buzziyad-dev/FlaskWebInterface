In a rapidly expanding food industry, individuals' appetites are basically interminable. They demand
newer dining options, leading to increased reliance on digital platforms to evaluate dining options.
However, there remains a significant gap in reliable and localized information about food enterprises in
Saudi Arabia, which Yalla will aim to solve. Yalla seeks to fill this gap by providing a platform dedicated
for sharing said information about prominent and newly-emerging restaurants, as well as informing users
about essential details such as menus, working hours, and dish categories. By improving the visibility of
small food enterprises and offering users trustworthy, up-to-date reviews, Yalla aims to support local
businesses and enhance the overall dining experience for its community.
Initially, the website will be limited to users in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. It will enable individuals to
contribute by sharing their own reviews and information about specific businesses, thereby informing
those who may be unfamiliar with local restaurants, such as tourists. Furthermore, it introduces users to a
wide range of cuisines they may not have previously experienced and encourages them to explore and try
new options. However, if the website's popularity increases, the website can expand its scope to other
cities in Saudi Arabia, such as Riyadh and Dammam. Currently, there are no plans for this website to
expand further, as doing so would require extensive planning and organization to broaden its
functionalities across the entirety of Saudi Arabia.
Surprisingly, no dedicated app currently enables users to review or rate restaurants across Jeddah, aside
from Google Maps. However, Google Maps may contain inaccurate, outdated, or biased reviews and
ratings. Yalla aims to mitigate these problems by providing reliable, up-to-date reviews that help users
more accurately assess whether a business is worth visiting, while also offering a broad selection of food
establishments for users to explore.
Another issue this website aims to tackle is lack of publicity. Many food enterprises are relatively
obscure, despite often offering significantly lower prices than larger competitors for similar products.
Through Yalla, these restaurants can gain increased visibility, helping them avoid closure while enabling
users to discover and enjoy the unique offerings of these restaurants.
Essentially, the website includes short-term and long-term objectives. Short-term objectives are, but not
limited to, laying the foundation of the platform, experimenting with adding new places to review,
implementing an account and login system, and creating a tab to search for restaurants with specific tags.
Long-term objectives include hosting the website on its own domain, leaderboards and titles for top
reviewers, collaboration with businesses to advertise their restaurants within the application, and
implementing a pick-up-your-food functionality. Furthermore, the website aims to solve some primary
questions that include: (1) In what way can the website target small food businesses in Jeddah to increase
their visibility and engagement? (2) How can the website influence the KKIS community while
discovering and supporting small food businesses in Jeddah? (3) What motivates food enterprises in
Jeddah to collaborate and participate with the website to promote their own business? Answering these
questions requires essential values that the platform will build on. These values include embracing
diversity, where food from different areas of the world, such as Jordanian, Saudi, Italian, Mexican, and
more food, are integrated as part of the website; stewardship, as users must ensure complete accuracy and
honesty in their reviews; community impact, as this platform benefits the community as a whole; and
cooperation and collaboration, where users must cooperate and collaborate to benefit the entire
community of the platform.
The main thesis, which the website is built on, is that if ratings, reviews, and information about food
businesses are made easily accessible through a simple web application, then users will be more likely to
discover, evaluate, and support businesses, particularly small ones, leading to greater visibility and
community engagement, because accessible and trustworthy reviews increase publicity and encourage
users to interact with a business. Validating this hypothesis requires data collection; therefore, this applied
course research will gather primary quantitative and qualitative data to support the website’s
improvement and optimization.
Furthermore, the website will be implemented over a period of six months, during which the project will
undergo updates and add features that give it its unique touch. October and November will serve as the
learning and foundational development phase, during which the researcher will acquire knowledge of
coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Python, and JavaScript. From December through March, new
functionalities will be progressively implemented, including features proposed by users and informed by
data gathered from primary sources.
In conclusion, with easily accessible information and reviews about food businesses through a web
application like Yalla, users are more encouraged to explore said businesses, namely small, growing
businesses, leading to a greater visibility and engagement across the website's community, which is
the website's purpose. Additional objectives of the website include increasing exposure for small
businesses, offering users diverse food and dish recommendations, and providing a dedicated section for
restaurant promotion. As the platform grows in popularity and user engagement, it may further expand its
coverage to additional cities in Saudi Arabia, such as Riyadh and Dammam.
